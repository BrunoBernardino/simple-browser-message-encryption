# Simple Browser Message Encryption

I built this tool so I could easily send an encrypted message/text via unsafe channels (and decrypt too) in a fairly secure way.

I always prefer PGP, but that requires technical knowledge from the other person I'm communicating with, and this doesn't.

Uses [Deno](https://deno.land) as a backend (though you could just serve the `src` directory with any other tool).

Deploy by pushing to the `main` branch.

View locally using `make start`.
