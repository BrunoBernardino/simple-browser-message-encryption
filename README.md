# Simple Browser Message Encryption

I built this tool so I could easily send an encrypted message/text via unsafe channels (and decrypt too) in a fairly secure way.

I always prefer PGP, but that requires technical knowledge from the other person I'm communicating with, and this doesn't.

## Development

View locally using `deno run --allow-net --allow-read https://deno.land/std@0.197.0/http/file_server.ts src` or `npx servo src`.

## Deployment

Just push to the `main` branch.
